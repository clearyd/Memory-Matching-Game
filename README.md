# Memory-Matching-Game

## What it is:
This is the classical memory matching game that all kids have played at some point in their childhood. There is a gameboard of thirty cards. The cards come in pairs that are randomly placed on the gameboard; each card has one and only one matching card. When the game begins, the fronts of the cards are quickly flashed, and then they are turned over so that only their backs show. The playerâ€™s goal is to find all the matches. The player can click on a card to flip the card over. Two cards are flipped on each turn. If the cards match, they remain flipped over and the player goes again. If the cards do not match, the cards flip to their backs and the player continues trying to find matches. The game ends when all the matches are found. After the player has won, the game resets and the player can play again.
